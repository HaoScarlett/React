# React Coding Projects and Study Notes

Hey there! Welcome to my React repository where I dump all my coding projects and the study notes I scribble down. Consider this repo as the digital equivalent of that one drawer we all have at home, where everything important (and occasionally, not-so-important) gets stashed.

## What's Inside?

- **Projects**: All the nifty little (and big) things I've built while navigating the React ecosystem. 
- **Study Notes**: My learnings, musings, and occasionally the "aha!" moments I have about React. 

## Why Am I Doing This?

1. **Daily Learning**: They say you learn something new every day. I try to code something new in React every day (or at least, every other day when life doesn't get in the way).
2. **Sharing is Caring**: Hopefully, my journey can help or inspire someone else on their own coding adventures. Or at least give you a good laugh when you see my early code attempts.
3. **It's Not Procrastination If It's Organized**: By keeping everything in one place, I'm one step away from chaos. 

Cheers to our React journey! Let's build stuff, break stuff, and learn incessantly. Happy coding! üë©üèª‚Äçüíª
